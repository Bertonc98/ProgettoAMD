[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Bertonc98/ProgettoAMD/blob/main/)

This repository contains an implementation of:
* Apriori algorithm
* PCY 
* SON (applied with Apriori and PCY)
* Toivonen (applied with Apriori and PCY)

All the algorithms are used to find the frequent itemsets in adataset, in this case is searched the frequent sets of actors that have worked together in movies. <br />
The code has been developed on Colab, accessible by the badge. <br />
These algorithms are applied over the dataset "IMDb dataset" downloadable from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ashirwadsangwan/imdb-dataset). <br />
To run the algorithms is needed to provide the "kaggle.json" in order to permit the use of the dataset. <br />
