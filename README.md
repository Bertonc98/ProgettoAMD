# AMD project by Bertoncini Alberto and Cavagna Massimo
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Bertonc98/ProgettoAMD/blob/main/)

This repository contains an implementation of:
* Apriori algorithm
* PCY 
* SON (applied with Apriori and PCY)
* Toivonen (applied with Apriori and PCY)

All the algorithms are used to find the frequent itemsets in a dataset, in this case are searched the frequent sets of actors that have worked together in movies, tv series or shorts. <br />
The code has been developed on Colab, accessible by the badge. <br />
These algorithms are applied over the dataset "IMDb dataset" downloadable from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ashirwadsangwan/imdb-dataset). <br />
To run the algorithms is needed to provide the "kaggle.json" in order to permit the use of the dataset. <br />
